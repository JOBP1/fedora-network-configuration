"The goal of this lab was to familiarize with Networkmonitoring tools like Zabbix and Nagios to monitor the health and the performance of the network, servers and the devices".
1.Installing & Configuring Nagios
sudo dnf install nagios

Installing Nagios Plugins
sudo dnf install nagios-plugins-all

2.Start Nagios
sudo systemctl start nagios
"Afterstarting it, I checked the status using 'sudo systemctl status nagios' to confirm it was running without errors".

3.Enabling Nagios
sudo systemctl enable nagios

4.Accessing the Web Interface"I Accessed my Chrome browser and  searhed http://192.168.1.100/nagios
"I logged in using the “nagiosadmin” account created during installation. I saw host and service status pages, confirming Nagios was working".

5. Nagios Configuration
"I edited files using /etc/nagios/ whereby I added hosts from my VM and Fedora so Nagios could monitor ping, CPU, and HTTP services".

6.Installing & Configuring Zabbix
# sudo dnf install https://repo.zabbix.com/zabbix/5.4/rhel/8/x86_64/zabbix-release-5.4
"I added the official Zabbix repo so I could install the server this redirected me to Maria DB"
        a. Logged Into MariaDB
          mysql -u root -p
          "logged in as the root database administrator. MariaDB prompted me for the root password, which I had set earlier during installation".
        b.Created the Zabbix Database
          "Inside MariaDB, I ran:
          CREATE DATABASE zabbix CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_bin;
        c. Created a Database User for Zabbix
          CREATE USER 'zabbix'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_password';
          "I created a dedicated user named zabbix and assigned it a strong password".
        d. Granted Permissions to the User
           GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON zabbix.* TO 'zabbix'@'localhost';
          "Then exited the Maria DB".
        e. Imported the Zabbix Database Schema
           zcat /usr/share/doc/zabbix-server-mysql*/create.sql.gz | mysql -u zabbix -p zabbix
           "I logged in using the zabbix user created earlier, this process took a little time because it imported hundreds of tables used by Zabbix".
        f. Updated the Zabbix Server Configuration
           sudo nano /etc/zabbix/zabbix_server.conf
        g. Started the Services
           sudo systemctl start zabbix-server zabbix-agent httpd
           sudo systemctl enable zabbix-server zabbix-agent httpd
           "Zabbix frontend became accessible"
        h. Accessed the Web Interface
           http://192.168.1.100/zabbix
           "I proceeded to Log in using the default username 'Admin' and password 'zabbix'
           "The dashboard showed no hosts yet, so I added my Fedora server through the Zabbix agent".

7.System & Network Performance Tuning
"To monitor the performance I tried the top and htop commands that showed CPU spikes from Zabbix".

8.Adjusting the Swappiness
sudo nano /etc/sysctl.conf
vm.swappiness = 10
sudo sysctl -p

9.Enabled the SSD Trim
sudo systemctl enable fstrim.timer
sudo systemctl start fstrim.timer
"On this configuration nothing happened so I run the command 'sudo systemctl status fstrim.timer' the service was enabled but the state wasn't running it was at waiting, I did some troubleshooting and some research that pointed to it being normal".

10.Tuning the TCP/IP
sudo nano /etc/security/limits.conf
"This opened up the GNU nano 8.3 text editor where I added the lines below"
* soft nofile 65535
* hard nofile 65535

11. Troubleshooting Common Networking Issues
nmcli "This displayed my connection which was enp0s3, lo and the DNS Configurations".
ip a "This displayed my inet addresses of the lo (loopback) and enp0s3
ping -c 4 8.8.8.8 "Return ping packets with 0% loss".
