"The main objextive of this lab was to successfully setup and manage an Apache HTTP Server on Fedora
1.Installing and Configuring Apache HTTP Server.
"I had to make sure that everything was up to date by running the command below"
sudo dnf update
sudo df install httpd

"This command allowed Fedora to install Apache and any required dependencies of which was a success".

2.Starting and Enabling Apache
"I started the service and enabled it so that Apache automatically boots on system startup, I then confirmed if the service was actively running using 'sudo systemctl status httpd' of which it displayed that the service status was actively running and enabled".
sudo systemctl start httpd
sudo systemctl enable httpd

3.Configuring the Firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
"At this step, I realized Apache wouldn’t be accessible externally unless I allowed HTTP traffic. After reloading firewalld, I confirmed the rule was active."

4.Verifying the Installation
"I visited http://192.168.1.100 (which is my server's IP) in the Google Chrome browser using the http and confirmed the Apache test page appeared. This was the first sign that the setup was working.

5.Apache Configuration
"On my PC the Apache’s configuration files were located in /etc/httpd. I identified the main config file and the conf.d folder where virtual hosts are placed."
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/mywebsite
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/mywebsite

6.Virtual Hosting and Site Configuration
"For my site configuration I used mycoolsite and the domain mycoolsite.com leading me to create the directory and changing ownership so Apache could serve files without permission errors".
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/mycoolsite
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/html/mycoolsite2

7.Create Virtual Host Files
<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@emycoolsite.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/mycoolsite
    ServerName mycoolsite.com
    ServerAlias www.mycoolsite.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/mycoolsite-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/mycoolsite-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

<VirtualHost *:80>
    ServerAdmin webmaster@mycoolsite2.com
    DocumentRoot /var/www/html/mycoolsite2
    ServerName mycoolsite2.com
    ServerAlias www.mycoolsite2.com
    ErrorLog /var/log/httpd/mycoolsite2-error.log
    CustomLog /var/log/httpd/mycoolsite2-access.log combined
</VirtualHost>

"I proceeded to save them inside /etc/httpd/conf.d/. directory".

8.Permissions
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/mycoolsite
sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/mycoolsite2

9.Test Configuration and Restart Apache
sudo apachectl configtest
sudo systemctl restart httpd
"After running these commands configtest returned Syntax OK, which confirmed that my virtual host files was correct. Restarting Apache applied all changes, and I was able to load both website directories locally".

10.Securing the Web Server with SSL/TLS
"I began with installing the SSL Tools which installed and updated he repositories successfully".
sudo dnf install httpd mod_ssl certbot python3-certbot-apache

11. Obtain SSL Certificates
sudo certbot --apache -d example.com -d www.example.com

"In this step, I followed Certbot prompts, entered my email, and successfully generated certificates. Certbot auto-configured the HTTPS virtual host"'

11.Test HTTPS
"I then accessed https://mycoolsite.com and confirmed that the site was still not accessible I think that the certifications had not gone through because tthere was an error prompt when generating the certifications I needed paid certifications to actively access the website".

12.Enabled HTTPS Through Firewall
sudo firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=https
sudo firewall-cmd --reload
